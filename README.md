## **Praise the Helix** ##
This is an simple Windows Phone app for all the followers from our Lord and Savior Helix Fossil, there's no much to talk about because this is really simple, but has some tips about how to do some things that i felt lost while developping my first WP8 app.

So feel free to branch or pull-request this, if you're going to use ads, don't forget to change the parameters from all the adControllers, unless you want to give me some money :D
